## Description:

A React App that takes a Spotify Playlist URL and transfers the playlist to the user's Apple Music Library.

## Run the Project Locally:

### Warning: To run this app locally, you'll first need to set up developer accounts for both Apple and Spotify. Uma Abu has a great video on how to do this (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS2J0dKcvAA&t=1s).
1. After cloning the project repo, run the command `yarn` in both the `client` and `server` directories.
2. Create an .env file in the server directory with both the Apple and Spotify client credentials (example below).

3. Run command `yarn start` in both the `server` and `client` directories.
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
